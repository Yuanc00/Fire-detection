# Fire-detection
## This project is based on [yolov5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5), using yolov5 to train fire detection
### The training and testing images are from [pexels](https://www.pexels.com/), and we will also use more images to train the model so that the model can achieve better detection results.
